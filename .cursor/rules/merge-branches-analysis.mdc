I'm trying to merge 2 branches;
see primary branch
see secondary branch

``` git branch primary
review git commits for this branch

``` git branch secondary
review git commits for this branch
```
what is the best way to merge this? I want to ensure 
- secondary branch
commits are not changed or the merge to cause breaking changes to the primary branch

- primary branch
review the commit from each branch and provide me an analysis and insight;

- do not code
