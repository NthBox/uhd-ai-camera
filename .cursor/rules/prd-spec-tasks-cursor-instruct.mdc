Follow these steps sequentially:

- create files under current folder and use the folder name as prefix
-- <foldername>-prd.md
-- <foldername>-spec.md
-- <foldername>-tasks.md


- review existing code base and write new and udpated <foldername>-prd.md 
```
read <foldername>-prd-llm.md and analyze how to implement the <foldername>-prd-llm plan with the existing code base and update the new prd <foldername>-prd.md;

use best practice design patterns, code style, and file structure patterns, non descructive and modular coding pattern ; do not code only 

update <foldername>-prd.md ; only target changes and updates in codebase that uses nextjs ; do not add new code, files, or folders outside scope file structure

prd should making changes to only in the project folder
```

- write spec based on <foldername>-prd.md and <foldername>-prod-llm.md;
```
use <foldername>-spec.md <foldername>-prd.md <foldername>-prd-llm.md 
write and update the spec <foldername>-spec.md  using prd <foldername>-prd.md
```

- write tasks based on prd and spec
```
use <foldername>-spec.md <foldername>-prd.md <foldername>-tasks.md 

plan and write the each tasks <foldername>-tasks.md  for incremental implementation to validate each task before moving forward using spec <foldername>-spec.md and prd<foldername>-prd.md
```
